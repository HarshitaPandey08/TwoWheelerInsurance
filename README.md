# TwoWheelerInsurance

The Original File is the dataset I downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset includes Vehicle insurance fraud conspiring to make false or exaggerated claims involving property damage or personal injuries following an accident.

I changed the dataset such that it gives information about Two Wheelers in India and their information related to their insurance.
The new dataset is used for analysis in tableau.
